# Udacity Data-Visualization-Using-Tableau

Project Description In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There were three datasets to choose from and I chose the YouTube dataset. 

Youtube Data US This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day. This data set will require some cleaning in excel prior to Tableau.

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "Meet Specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

Reminders Your visualization work should use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluated by reviewers. Host your dashboards/stories on Tableau Public, you'll be submitting them to reviewers and this makes them easily accessible.

Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.
